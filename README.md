# TakeABreak
A sample mac app which reminds me to take a break from work :).

This is what it has

You can set a custom message to be shown in intervals of 20 mins/ 40 mins and 60 mins. If you dont take break or no actions it will tell the time since a break.

This has helped me to take breaks during my work.
